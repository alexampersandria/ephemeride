# Color

The color palette used throughout Ephemeride's design system. Each color comes in multiple shades, ranging from light to dark. From `00` to `100` in increments of `10`.

## Base

Base also includes `05` and `95` shades for extra light and extra dark variants and thus has two more steps than the other colors.
